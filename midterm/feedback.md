Good descriptions and docstrings throughout. Thank you!

## Step 1
* Nice work.  Your variable names might have gotten a bit long there, but I'd rather have them a little more verbose than hard to understand.  In contrast, `i` is a bit non-descript.

## Step 2
* You have an `else` statement that is out of place here. I think what you needed was just to remove the `else:` and outdent the `return None` by one tab.  Right now, you have an orphan `else` statement with no `if` at the same level before it.  I've deducted 1 point for _Correctness_.

## Step 3
* No comments. Nice work.

## Step 4
* Nice work. Easy to follow.
