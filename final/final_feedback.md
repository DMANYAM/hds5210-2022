# Feedback on Final

It wasn't entirely clear from your opening documentation how your project was going to achieve the result you intend.  Without additional documentation along the way (other than some basic comments), I found your final project difficult to follow.

While you did create a Python class in your last couple of cells to manage interaction with your interactive input, you didn't use any abstraction or modularization in the body of your project where we would expect you to create specific functions to do transformations or specific calculations.  The point of using functions throughout your code is to make testing and validation easier.  (-10 from Modularity and Style)

Your analysis of the low and high confidence limits was interesting, but I'm not sure why plotted those histograms. The goal of those steps wasn't clear to me.


Overall, I think your project had a good direction and you had some interesting data to work with.  I would have liked to see some more transformation and examination of other variables in your data and it would have been helpful to have more text to describe your approach to this analysis.
